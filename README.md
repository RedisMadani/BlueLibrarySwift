## Description

BlueLibrarySwift is a Swift app that serves as a comprehensive demonstration of various design patterns. It showcases the implementation of different design patterns across three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. The app provides examples of the following design patterns:

- Creational: Singleton
- Structural: MVC, Decorator, Adapter, Facade
- Behavioral: Observer, Command, Memento

By exploring this app, you can gain a better understanding of how these design patterns can be utilized in Swift projects.

## Features

- Demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns using Swift.
- Provides examples for each of the following design patterns: Singleton, MVC, Decorator, Adapter, Facade, Observer, Command, and Memento.
- Offers insights into when and how to apply each design pattern effectively.
